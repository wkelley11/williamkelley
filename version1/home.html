      <p>Hello, my name is Will.  Thanks for checking out my site!  The idea for this
        page came from my older brother, who you can meet on his own page <a href="https://hughkelley.github.io/">here</a>.
        Basically, I'm going to remake the site a few times to practice web design using
        a variety of different development frameworks.  This iteration is made with HTML and some
        CSS.  I'm not sure if this should be surprising or not, but I've just completed
        a B.A. in C.S. having never really touched HTML or CSS.  I even took "Software
        Development"!  But anyway, I guess I'm getting my hands all over it now.
