  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>DeltaMath was a world apart from my past experience. Before accepting the job, I had a long conversation with my
      favorite
      math teacher from highschool, who raved about DeltaMath and was very excited at the prospect of knowing someone
      there. Other than my boss and the company's founder, I was the only software developer
      there when I was first hired. We already had a working product with millions of users, so my first projects were
      focused on
      making internal business tasks easier and automated.

        Quil Health </a>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>My first job out of college was at a health tech "startup" called Quil. It was a cool expierience, and a great
      way to ease into
      working in a remote-first environment while most companies were still struggling to adjust to the mid-COVID
      difficulties of operating
      a large workforce. I got to work closely with a contracted dev team from Monterrey, Mexico to quickly build and
      scale
      our product, while also reporting to well-established principle engineers from Comcast and Independance Blue Cross
      -- the two
      companies sponsoring the project.
      <br /><br />
      Ultimately though, the product idea just wasn't great. Most people seemed either confused or ambivalent about why
      people would ever use
      the technology we were creating, which didn't feel like a great environment to be in.

    <p>One year in college, I took a class called <a target="_blank"

        Analysis</a>. I found the topic facinating, and ended up working for the professor
      who taught the course over the summer that same year. The project I worked on was a continuation of his work at
      Mount Sinai. We created an ML
      model to predict the genotypes of <a target="_blank"
