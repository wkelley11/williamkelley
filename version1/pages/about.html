    <div class="">
      <p>I am about to graduate from Middlebury College in Vermont.  I studied Computer
        Science, with minors in Spanish and Gender, Sexuality, & Feminist Studies.
        I also liked taking classes in the Religion and Political Science departments.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Gap Year</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>I took a year off between high school and college to live abroad through
        the <a href="https://www.rotary.org/en/our-programs/youth-exchanges">Rotary Youth Exchange</a> program.
        Rotary was originally a business/social club oriented around public service
        (I think they championed the search for a polio vaccine).  Now, they pay for
        high schoolers to live in a different household somewhere around the world
        for a year.
