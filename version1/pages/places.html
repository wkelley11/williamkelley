  <div class="">
    <p>I currently live and work in Santa Cruz. It is a big change of pace from New York, but am loving the
      opportunity to slow down a bit an focus on endeavors away from the hustle and bustle of NYC.

    <p>After graduating from college, I moved to the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. I really enjoyed living
      there,
      passing many hours exploring the city on my bike.

    <p>I went to college in a small town in central Vermont. I loved the natural environment there,

    <p>I took a year off between high school and college to live abroad through
      the <a href="https://www.rotary.org/en/our-programs/youth-exchanges">Rotary Youth Exchange</a> program.
      Rotary was originally a business/social club oriented around public service
      (I think they championed the search for a polio vaccine). Now, they pay for
      high schoolers to live in a different household somewhere around the world
      for a year.
