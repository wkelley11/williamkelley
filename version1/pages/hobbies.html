        I like to run. My interest was sparked while I was abroad in Chile after high school.
        I played soccer and lacrosse--fairly poorly, but equally competitively--throughout high school
        and really most of my life.  I needed some outlet, but living on a farm
        did not lend itself very well to team sports.  Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_rodeo">
        Chilean rodeo</a> is an individual endeavor if you don't count the livestock. Long story
        short I started running a lot with no goal in mind other than to
        generally exhert myself.

        While my leg speed might have suffered from aimless miles, I did develop two things
        that have since served me quite well: a solid aerobic base; and more importantly,
        the ability to clear my mind and find solace while running.
