  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>I began biking as a form of rehab after tearing my ACL skiing in Vermont. I quickly fell in love with the
      activity in its own right, and bought my first bike on <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.bikesdirect.com/">Bikes Direct</a>.
      I spent the next year biking up and down the "gaps" over the Green Mountains, finding new trails, swimming holes,
      and people who shared my interest in bopping around on two wheels.

      After moving to New York, I faced the fact that there were fewer natural beauties to be found in the concrete
      jungle.
      I decided to mix things up by getting involved in the bike racing scene there, and making a fixed gear Surly
      Steamroller
      my main mode of transportation. You can find most of my past and future cycling adventures on my <a

    <p>
      I like to run. My interest was sparked while I was abroad in Chile after high school.
      I played soccer and lacrosse--fairly poorly, but equally competitively--throughout high school
      and really most of my life. I needed some outlet, but living on a farm
      did not lend itself very well to team sports. Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_rodeo">
        Chilean rodeo</a> is an individual endeavor if you don't count the livestock. Long story
      short I started running a lot with no goal in mind other than to
      generally exhert myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my leg speed might have suffered from aimless miles, I did develop two things
      that have since served me quite well: a solid aerobic base; and more importantly,
      the ability to clear my mind and find solace while running.

  <div class="">
    <p>I played saxaphone and piano growing up and throughout high school. I've lost most of my touch, but hopefully I
      will someday play my way
      through the 300 page Bill Evans OMNIBOOK on the keyboard stand.
