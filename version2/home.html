    <div class="">
      <p>Hello, my name is Will.  Thanks for checking out my site!  The idea for this
        page came from my older brother, who you can meet on his own page <a href="https://hughkelley.github.io/">here</a>.
        Basically, I'm going to remake the site a few times to practice web design using
        a variety of different development frameworks.  This is the second iteration,
        which includes some JavaScript on top of the HTML from the first version.
        It's going to be pretty bare bones--just some scripting embedded directly
        into the HTML.  In the Software Development class I took, we jumped straight
        into React and some higher level style libraries, so I missed out on a lot
        of the "normal" stuff.  I wasn't sure exactly what features to add that would
        best highlight the addition of JavaScript into the mix.  I'm starting with
        an interactive map of my ~travels~ on the "About" page, but please let me
        know if you have any fun suggestions! (Unless you are going to tell me to make
        a clock...I don't want to). 
      </p>

      Click me to display Date and Time.
