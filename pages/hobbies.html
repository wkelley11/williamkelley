        I like to run. My interest was sparked while I was abroad in Chile after high school.
        I played soccer and lacrosse--poorly, but very competitively--throughout high school
        and really most of my life.  I needed some physical outlet, but living on a farm
        did not lend itself very well to team sports.  Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_rodeo">
        Chilean rodeo</a> is an individual endeavor if you don't count the livestock. Long story
        short, I started running a lot.  I did not have any goal in mind other than to
        generally exhert myself, something I have at times regretted when I wish I was
        faster than I am.
      </p>

        While my leg speed might have suffered from aimless miles, I did develop two things
        that have since served me quite well: an pretty dank aerobic base; and more importantly,
        the ability to clear my mind and find solace while running.
